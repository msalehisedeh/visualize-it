# Welcome to visualize-it!

Have you ever wanted to visually look at a set of interconnected data and derive insightful information from it? 
Have you wondered how long will it take to do it? Well... wonder no more and add this component into your project... 

This code is copied and enhanced from http://bl.ocks.org/eyaler/10586116. The intention here is to make it easier to use and make it accessible to angular application.

**NOTE:** Starting with version 1.5.1 all previous versions are deprecated and you need to import this library through @sedeh/visualize-it. Future bug fixes / enhancements will be on @sedeh scope.
